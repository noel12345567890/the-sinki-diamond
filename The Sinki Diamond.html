  <p>The Sinki Diamond has been found by Professor Thakur and Miss Lily.
  <p>This beautiful Diamond is over 1 trillion years old and is worth over Â£100,000,000,000 trillion!!!!!
  <p>The diamond is 200 hundred carats!!! (More than gold!!!)
  <p>This is the most valuable item in the world!!!
  <p>The diamond was made in MORDOR by a man called Mr.S, we don't know who this is but, he must have been rich!!!
  <p>During the Russian Revolution, the Sinki Diamond was stolen from the Nobleman's palace in St Petersburg, so for the next 30 years, the Sinki Diamond's whereabouts were unknown. But now it has been found and it will be kept in the Kelvingrove Museum.
